Convert PNG/JPG/BMP images into Forza Horizon 6 Vinyl Group layers. The app handles generation, preview, and import in one desktop window; normal users do not need Python, `.venv`, batch files, or manual memory addresses.

> **Download the EXE:** get `forza-painter-fh6-v1.8.4.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/bvzrays/forza-painter-fh6/releases) and run it directly.

> **Preset Market:** browse shared images, presets, and JSON packages at https://painter6.com or use the new in-app market banner.

> **If the result looks blurry:** raise `Random samples` first. Values above **200000** usually make a major quality difference; higher values are clearer but take much longer to generate.

> **Import can take time:** v1.4.1+ tries multiple FH6 template locators and can spend up to 5 minutes finding the safe layer table. Keep FH6 in Vinyl Group Editor, do not switch menus, and export a detailed log if it still fails.

## Quick Start

1. Download `forza-painter-fh6-v1.8.4.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/bvzrays/forza-painter-fh6/releases).
2. Put the EXE in a normal writable folder, for example `Desktop\forza-painter-fh6`.
3. Double-click the EXE. For FH6 import, run it as administrator if Windows blocks process access.
4. In FH6, open `Create Vinyl Group` / `Vinyl Group Editor`, load a sphere template, then `Ungroup` it.
5. In the app, generate JSON, open the `Import` page, enter the exact template layer count, then import.

Do not download GitHub's automatic `Source code` ZIP unless you are developing the project. Normal users only need the `.exe`.

## Generate JSON

1. Open the `Generate JSON` page.
2. Click `Add images` and choose PNG/JPG/BMP images.
3. Select a quality preset.
4. Optional: enable `Use custom settings` to change output layers, resolution, random samples, and mutated samples.
5. Click the fixed bottom `Start generating` button.
6. Wait for the preview and logs to update.

Generated files are saved beside the source image, for example `image.500.json`, `image.1000.json`, and `image.3000.json`.

One image can generate multiple checkpoint JSON files. Prefer the highest-layer JSON that matches your template; for example, use `image.3000.json` or the final `image.json` with a 3000-layer template. Importing a 500-layer JSON into a 3000-layer template will look blurry.

| Preset | Output layers | Random samples | Use case |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| extremely fast | 500 | 30000 | Quick composition checks |
| fast | 1000 | 60000 | Quick usable drafts |
| balanced | 1800 | 120000 | Recommended default |
| slow | 2500 | 220000 | Final quality; starts using the 200k+ quality range |
| super slow | 3000 | 350000 | Best clarity, very slow |

## Import JSON

1. Start FH6 and keep `Vinyl Group Editor` open.
2. Load or create a template made from many simple sphere layers.
3. `Ungroup` the template and remember the exact in-game layer count.
4. In the app, open `Import`, click `Refresh`, and select `forzahorizon6.exe`.
5. Enter the exact template layer count.
6. Add the generated `.json`, or click `Use generated JSON`.
7. Leave advanced address fields empty and click `Import JSON`.

FH needs 4 extra boundary layers to save the cover and apply bounds correctly. Example: a 1000-layer JSON should use at least a 1004-layer template; a 3000-layer template can import about 2996 drawable shapes.

## Experimental Full-Shape Import/Export

v1.8.1 adds a new Region Paint tab for iterative region-focused painting; v1.8.0 adds FH6 type-code JSON research support directly to the main workflow: import full-shape/type-code JSONs from the `Import` page, and export the current editable FH6 group from the `Export` page.

Use this only for full-shape JSONs. Normal generated ellipse JSON should still use the regular `Import` page.

- Export is read-only and validates the editable FH6 layer table before writing JSON.
- Import auto-detects full-shape/type-code JSONs from the normal JSON list and expects a saved/reopened plain white circle template, usually 3000 layers, ungrouped before import.
- Supported full-shape JSON markers include `type_word`, `shape_word`, FH6 full type codes, Kloudy/Fabric handmade JSON fields, font-shape fields, and simple primitive names like `Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle`, and `Ellipse`.
- Type-code JSON previews use bundled FH6 vinyl vertex resources, so multi-shape JSONs from the new exporter and Kloudy/Fabric-style handmade JSONs can be previewed without rectangle fallbacks.
- Mask layers are previewed as transparent cutouts against already drawn lower layers; FH6 UI thumbnails may still show the mask shape itself.
- After full-shape import, save and reopen the vinyl group before judging the result; FH6 can keep showing stale live template resources in the current editor.
- If full-shape import/export fails, the app shows a direct reminder for the important FH6/editor/template checks. Use `Export full-shape report` only when you need to send debug data.
- The importer writes only stable visual fields and the 16-bit shape word at layer offset `0x7A`.
- It does not copy volatile FH6 resource pointers such as `0xA8`.
- After import completes, save and reload the FH6 vinyl group before judging stale UI thumbnails.

## Experimental Region Paint

Region Paint is an iterative painting workflow that generates a base layer pass across the whole image, then lets you select regions (using Rectangle or Ellipse tools) and refine only those areas with additional layers.

- Add a single image, choose a Quality Profile (which sets the Total budget from `stopAt`), and adjust First-pass and Region layers.
- Click `Start First Pass` to generate base layers. A preview appears on the right canvas.
- Use the Rectangle or Ellipse tool on the left canvas to draw a selection region. The red overlay shows your selection.
- Click `Paint Selected Region` to add more layers only inside that region. Repeat for each area.
- After all passes, use `Open Result Folder` or `Save Result JSON` to get the final `base.json`.
- Import the result JSON using the `Import` tab — same workflow as standard generation.
- The remaining budget is shown next to `Remaining`. Each region pass consumes layers from this budget.

## Important Rules

- The FH6 template must be ungrouped before import.
- The layer count in the app must exactly match the game.
- Do not switch game menus while importing.
- After restarting FH6, reloading the template, or changing layer count, import again with the new correct count.
- If JSON has fewer layers than the template, unused template layers are hidden.
- If JSON has more layers than the template, extra shapes are trimmed.
- Transparent PNG backgrounds are not imported as visible backgrounds.

## Runtime Files

The one-file EXE extracts its internal files temporarily and stores normal runtime data outside the EXE. The app shows the exact paths in the startup log.

Expected external folders beside the EXE:

- `runtime/`: logs, generated session data, and temporary app files.
- `webui-data/`: local browser/UI cache.

These folders can be deleted when the app is closed if you want to reset local runtime data.

## Troubleshooting

- **EXE will not import into FH6:** close the app and run the EXE as administrator.
- **GPU/OpenCL error:** update NVIDIA/AMD/Intel graphics drivers. The bundled generator uses OpenCL.
- **Template cannot be located:** confirm you are in Vinyl Group Editor, the template is ungrouped, the layer count is exact, and the menu was not changed during scanning.
- **Imported result is blurry:** use a higher-layer JSON or increase `Output layers` / `Random samples`.
- **Need help debugging:** use `Export detailed log` in the app and attach the log to an issue.

## Changelog

Only versioned release entries are kept here. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the app update prompt changelog.

### v1.8.5 / 2026-06-13

- **Region Paint budget guard**: Clicking `Start First Pass` when First-pass layers exceed Total Budget, or clicking `Paint Selected Region` when used layers + Region layers exceed Total Budget, now shows a clear log warning and stops instead of silently overrunning the budget.
- **Multi-direction drag support**: Rectangle and Ellipse selection tools in Region Paint now work when dragging in any direction (e.g. bottom-right to top-left). Previously non-top-left-to-bottom-right drags would fail with a mask generation error.
- **Clear mask improvements**: The `Clear All` button (renamed from "Clear Mask") removes all selection masks. A new `Clear Selected` button deletes only the currently selected mask, logging a hint if nothing is selected.
- **Small-screen accessibility**: Duplicate `Open Result Folder` and `Save Result JSON` buttons added inside the scrollable Step 3 area with a "(for small screens)" hint, so laptop users can still access result actions when the bottom buttons are off-screen.

### v1.8.4 / 2026-06-07

- Region Paint selection shapes now support **drag to move**, **corner resize**, and **rotation** (slider, scroll wheel, entry box, or on-canvas handle).
- Added a recommended preset that delivers great quality with relatively low compute power.

### v1.8.3 / 2026-06-06

- Added a **Heatmap** tab to the Region Paint canvas, showing shape density across the generated image with a colour-scale bar. The heatmap is automatically generated after each pass and cached for instant tab switching.
- Significantly improved Region Paint preview image generation speed.

### v1.8.2 / 2026-06-06

- Removed the Feather control from Region Paint's Step 3 selection tools. Selection masks are now always hard-edged (0 feather) to fix issues with the Paint Selected Region feature.

### v1.8.1 / 2026-06-05

- Added Region Paint — a new iterative painting workflow. Generate a base layer pass across the whole image, then select regions (using Rectangle or Ellipse tools) and refine only those areas with additional layers. Includes layer budget management, pass history, live preview canvas, and result JSON export.
- Fixed the UI log area at the bottom of the window being partially hidden behind Notebook tabs.

### v1.8.0 / 2026-06-01

- Updated the app version to `v1.8.0`; release packages now use `forza-painter-fh6-v1.8.0.exe`.
- Added experimental full-shape import/export flow: full-shape import lives on the `Import` page, and current-group export lives on the `Export` page.
- Full-shape import/export uses the 16-bit shape word at layer offset `0x7A` and avoids volatile resource pointers such as `0xA8`.
- Included Kloudy's FH6 Painter custom-importer attribution, font-shape registry, and FH6 vinyl resource data for type-code JSON support and previews.

### v1.7.0 / 2026-06-01
